# Introduction

> In this week, we'll be introducing the concept of interactive data visualization. We'll be working with a messy dataset you all created and fetch this data from a makeshift API. We'll also introduce the final assignments and requirements you need to fullfill beforehand. On Friday, we'll go deeper into JavaScript, and how we can use it to manipulate, transform and prepare datasets for our purposes.

## Planning

### Monday

Welcome to the Tech-Track! Today, we'll introduce the course, your teachers, the curriculum, assessment and all other practical information. After your first lecture, you'll be given the task of filling in a survey. It may look like quite a shitty survey, but you'll find out soon enough why we're working with this survey. For the rest of the day, you'll be setting up your GitHub repository, VS Code environment and projects. If you're feeling dapper, you can also start by fetching the API with our data and play around.

### Tuesday

We have compiled a list of three exercises, each gradually increasing in difficulty. Start with the easiest, and make your way up until the latest. For the first exercise, an example and solution will be provided. For the second and third, we'll discuss those on Friday.

### Wednesday

Today, we'll discuss data visualizations for the web. We're introducing SVG (Scalable Vector Graphs) and start by visualizing the data we've collected on Monday.

### Thursday

We're continuing our work from Wednesday with two new exercises. One involves rendering a table containing the raw data, the second one involves some data cleaning / normalizing / transforming and using this to prepare the data before creating a tabular view.

### Friday

On Friday, the final lesson of this week is a deep-dive in JavaScript. We'll introduce some advanced topics, such as functional programming, mutabillity, seperation of concerns and key build-in functions JavaScript already has. We'll introduce the `.map()`, `.filter()` and `.reduce()` methods and start chaining functions together in our programs.
