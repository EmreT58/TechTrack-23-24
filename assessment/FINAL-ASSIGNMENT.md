# Final assignment

> For your final assignment, you'll be creating an *interactive data visualization* using *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript*. That's it, that's the assignment.

## Description

The Tech-Track final assessment is an *individual*, *oral* test in which you demonstrate your interactive data visualization, can elaborate and defend design choices, and explain rationale behind the chosen stack or technical solutions.

### What?

* A dashboard, or an experience, or both. You've build a website in the broadest sense possible that conveys knowledge by parsing data and visualizing it.
* Documentation. A clear readme with the who-what-where of your website, installation instructions and external requirements. In addition, a wiki documenting your progress and proces. Including (sketch)notes of all guest lectures and documented choices based on valid research.

### When?

Your deadline is the _thursday_ of _week 6_ at _23:59_. All orals are on Friday

### Where?

You hand in a `.zip` file (the one you can download from GitHub) on [DLO](https://dlo.mijnhva.nl/d2l/home/437179). This contains all your documentation (wiki) and work (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). In addition, the website you've created is live and accesible for your teachers without the need to download something or run a local server.

## Requirements

*General*

* Your website is handed in on DLO, is live on the internet for teachers to access and your GitHub contains a wiki with your process report.
* Your deliverables have been handed in before the agreed upon deadline, which is the day before your oral assessment at 23:59.
* Your code is clean, structured and contains no errors or bugs.
* You've made sketchnotes / a report regarding the guest lectures, or have documented an article you've previously checked with a teacher

*Architecture*

* You're using at least one source of data.
* You've either documented the process of transforming / cleaning this data, or have written code that enables you to parse the data before using it in the website
* You're using at least one (non-micro) library or framework, and utlize this in a useful manner.
* 


## Goals

*  Clean, transform data with functional programming patterns
*  Create interactive visualizations from (external) data
*  Use D3 or other frameworks to create interactive visualization(s)
*  Work with front-end framework and think in components
*  Apply meaningul animation and / or storytelling in your visualization.
*  Refactor, debug and read complex programs (code)

## Grading

You will be graded in an oral assessment on the final day of the Tech-Track. For the grading form used, please [visit the GRADING.md file](./GRADING.md).
