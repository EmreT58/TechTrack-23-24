# Final assignment

> For your final assignment, you'll be creating an *interactive data visualization* using *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript*. That's it, that's the assignment.

## Description

The Tech-Track final assessment is an *individual*, *oral* test in which you demonstrate your interactive data visualization, can elaborate and defend design choices, and explain rationale behind the chosen stack or technical solutions.

### What?

* A dashboard, or an experience, or both. You've build a website in the broadest sense possible that conveys knowledge by parsing data and visualizing it.
* Documentation. A clear readme with the who-what-where of your website, installation instructions and external requirements. In addition, a wiki documenting your progress and proces. Including (sketch)notes of all guest lectures and documented choices based on valid research.

### When?

Your deadline is the _thursday_ of _week 6_ at _23:59_. All orals are on Friday

### Where?

You hand in a `.zip` file (the one you can download from GitHub) on [DLO](https://dlo.mijnhva.nl/d2l/home/437179). This contains all your documentation (wiki) and work (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). In addition, the website you've created is live and accesible for your teachers without the need to download something or run a local server.

## Requirements

## Goals

*  Clean, transform data with functional programming patterns
*  Create interactive visualizations from (external) data
*  Use D3 or other frameworks to create interactive visualization(s)
*  Work with front-end framework and think in components
*  Apply meaningul animation and / or storytelling in your visualization.
*  Refactor, debug and read complex programs (code)
