# Introduction

> In week 2, we will be setting up the foundation of your interactive data visualization. In paralel, you'll be working on the dataset(s) you wish to use by doing indepentent research, as well as start by concepting possible (types of) visualizations. For inspiration, we recommend Observable HQ or the cases of students from the previous years.


## Planning

### Monday

Today, we'll discuss and set up the tech stack you'll be using. Since this course only includes FED, no form of back-end is required. [We've set up](./boilerplate) a small [boilerplate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) to get everyone up and ready. If you feel your own setup will be a better fit, or you would like to improve on the existing one: Be sure to do so!

### Tuesday

We're expecting you to conduct some research into public datasets today, and maybe explore possible ways of visualization. In addition, you're going to inspect some online and interactive visualizations and analyze them in order to decide possible methods of visualizing for your own project.

### Wednesday

Cas Obdamn, a data engineer from DEPT will be over today to explain why managing large datasets properly is important, and how the skills you'll be learning today can be used in a professional environment.

### Thursday

Today we'll continue on your research from tuesday. It is expected you make adequate choices and create or fetch the dataset you're going to visualize.

### Friday

Today, we'll finalize our set up for the coming 4 weeks. We'll discuss libraries and frameworks, and learn to import them using NPM. In addition, we'll also introduce concepts like Sass and/or TypeScript. You're free to choose or ignore these elements as you please, but it's good to familiarize yourself with them.

## Resources

Below is a list of references and resources. The academic ones are purely for reference, the practical ones can be read to explore in-class subjects deeper.

### Practical

> Most of what Curran has to offer is of impeccable value if you wish to create visualizations for the web. You can find all of his work on [Datavis 2020](https://datavis.tech/datavis-2020/), to make sure you spend your time well, we advise you to at least look at the following items:

 - [Preparing Data for Visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tJV3jMHyEQ)
 - [Visualization of current events](https://datavis.tech/visualizations-of-current-events/)
