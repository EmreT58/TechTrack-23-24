# Thursday assignment

> We'll expect you to continue on your work from tuesday. Today, hard choices have to be made. Which dataset do you want to use? Are there multiple? How can you access them? Are you using a local JSON one, or are you setting up an API endpoint? Perhaps even GraphQL. Once again, means and methods are less important than getting actual results. If your API is unreliable, perhaps try and save the JSON it generates so you can prototype with it.

## Assignment

 - Finish the assignments set on [Tuesday](./TUESDAY.md), and define hard choices so you can benchmark your visualization. Remember, it's best to formulate goals, not one final product. Start with a simple visualization and if you're satisfied, move on to a more complex one. This is how you build your final product.

 - You've been playing around with the [boilerplate](../boilerplate) from Monday. We now expect you to have it fully up and running so you can implement your choices and ideas. Usage of codepen / vizhub or other external tools is still valid, but only for experimenting, templating or sharing your problem / code with someone. Be sure to utilize GitHub as well and keep your repository well updated from now on.
