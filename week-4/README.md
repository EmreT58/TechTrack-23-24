# Introduction

> [OooooOooooooooh, we're halfway there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDK9QqIzhwk). Week 4 marks the introduction of storytelling. Although we will mostly be focusing on providing our users with the most cunning edge technical solutions, it is vital to understand how they work and how people can be persuaded to read through an entire datavisulization. This week marks some theoretical work on princples of storytelling / animation, as well as reading documentation on technical solutions to achieve those.

## Planning

### Monday

On Monday we'll discuss working asynchronously in JavaScript. When you work with external APIs, you often have to wait for a bit for data to come back. We don't want our application to freeze while this happens, so you'll learn patterns that allow you to handle this properly.


### Tuesday
*As an exception, our workgroup is on Tuesday this week.* We'll work on how to document technical design choices (and research) in your design rationale.

### Wednesday

Wednesday is [all about snap.](https://twitter.com/argyleink/status/1556669441005330438). Today, we want you to watch all 49 minutes of Adam Argyle on scroll snap! [We have the slides available](https://oh-snap.netlify.app/#intro) as well, created with scroll snap as well. Scroll snap is a very useful way of navigating our users throughout our website. Be sure to write down interesting finds and document how you would use them on your website.

### Thursday

Continue working on your data visualization. Make sure you also think about how you wish to apply all principles we've discussed this week in your final product. We have some small things we want you to look at, introducting [animate.css](https://animate.style/#best-practices). We've immediately linked to their best practices since those are valid for everything we've learned so far.

### Friday

We'll be doing a quick recap of keyframes in CSS, the principles of transition, as well as visit some examples and sources, and finally: the introduction fo [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/). to create your own animations. See, we're still applying some motion design towards what we've been doing.
