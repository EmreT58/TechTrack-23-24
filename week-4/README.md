# Introduction

> [OooooOooooooooh, we're halfway there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDK9QqIzhwk). Week 4 marks the introduction of storytelling. Although we will mostly be focusing on providing our users with the most cunning edge technical solutions, it is vital to understand how they work and how people can be persuaded to read through an entire datavisulization. This week marks some theoretical work on princples of storytelling / animation, as well as reading documentation on technical solutions to achieve those.

## Planning

### Monday

We're starting monday early. We'll be doing a quick recap of keyframes in CSS, the principles of transition, as well as visit some examples and sources, and finally: the introduction fo [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/). to create your own animations. See, we're still applying some motion design towards what we've been doing.

### Tuesday

Tuesday is [all about snap.](https://twitter.com/argyleink/status/1556669441005330438). Today, we want you to watch all 49 minutes of Adam Argyle on scroll snap! [We have the slides available](https://oh-snap.netlify.app/#intro) as well, created with scroll snap as well. Scroll snap is a very useful way of navigating our users throughout our website. Be sure to write down interesting finds and document how you would use them on your website.

### Wednesday

Wednesday is all about parsing the information we took from our lessons on Monday and Tuesday, in addition, we're thrilled to have [Roos Verkade from NOSop3](https://nos.nl/op3) to talk about their project [Flitser](https://app.nos.nl/op3/flitsbezorging/#/).

### Thursday

Continue working on your data visualization. Make sure you also think about how you wish to apply all principles we've discussed this week in your final product. We have some small things we want you to look at, introducting [animate.css](https://animate.style/#best-practices). We've immediately linked to their best practices since those are valid for everything we've learned so far.

### Friday

All out! Today we're going to highlight some amazing stuff other people made, we're going to dive into these visual (web) stories and dissect them. What can we learn from them? How can we apply the cool things they've done in our visuals?
