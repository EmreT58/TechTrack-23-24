# Thursday assignment

> Life is a learning path that in order to be able to carry it we must live it. Basically since we will never learn from the experience of others. Only through our experiences, making and accepting mistakes, we can draw our own conclusions to move forward. (Mochi-Robot, 2020)

## Assignment(s)

 - A practical one, you know have some basic knowledge regarding how D3 functions, it's time to implement your own dataset. Perhaps you wish to use an API you found, or else use the example dataset we made in week 1. The most important thing is that you're able to feed data into D3 and realise a visualization. If this works, you can try by creating different visualizations and / or change the styling of them.

## Deliverables

> The following items should be included in your documentation

 - All of this is part of your process, do not forget to document your progress and experiments. All of your experiments build toward your goal. Make sure to write down the process!
