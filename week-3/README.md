# Introduction

> This week marks the start of actually creating an interactive visualization! You've been well equipped with ideas and knowledge to set up your own project folder and a goal. Now it's time to act on it. For this week, our primary focus will be the [D3.js library](https://d3js.org/) by [Mike Bostock](https://twitter.com/mbostock).

You've passed 1/3rd of the Tech Track! Many congratulations on making it this far. Now, deep breath in, deep breath out. We'll start today with our introduction of [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). We'll combine our knowledge of week 1 with our basic concept of week 2 to create our first graphs. Exciting times!

### Friday

You've been exploring D3 for a week now, it's time to start the final part of the saga, the interactive part of D3. We're going to touch on the `enter()`, `update()` and `exit()` cycle to update our graphs as new data, or filtered data comes along.
