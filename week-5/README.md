# Introduction

> From here on out, you've had all the lessons you need to create an interactive data visualization for the web. This week, we're focusing on some deep dives into advanced topics (optional), feedback and preperation for the assessment.

## Planning

### Monday

Vincent and Robert will both be giving workshops on geospatial and temporal data. Mainly how to handle GeoJSON and work with d3.time() or the `Date` object in JavaScript

### Tuesday

Continue with your work, don't forget: Your documentation is also being graded! If you wish to see what you're graded on, do check the [grading form](../assessment/FINAL-ASSIGNMENT.md). If you have any questions, write them down so you can discuss them tomorrow.


### Wednesday

Today is Q&A, there are individual talks with all students by the teacher to assess their process. Document this feedback in your Wiki.

### Thursday

Continue with your work.

### Friday

Today will be a lecture on how we expect you to present and document your work. We'll be explaining how to deploy your site as well, using a modern system such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
