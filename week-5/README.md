# Introduction

> From here on out, you've had all the lessons you need to create an interactive data visualization for the web. This week, we're focusing on some deep dives into advanced topics (optional), feedback and preperation for the assessment.

## Planning

### Monday

Vincent will give a workshop on working with geospatial data. We'll discuss several options that allow you to display data on interactive maps with D3 and other libraries.

### Tuesday

Continue with your work, don't forget: Your documentation is also being graded! If you wish to see what you're graded on, do check the [grading form](../assessment/FINAL-ASSIGNMENT.md). If you have any questions, write them down so you can discuss them tomorrow.


### Wednesday

Today Laura will give a workshop on working with temporal data. Working with dates and times brings a whole sets of challenges that often come up during data visualisation projects.

### Thursday

Continue with your work.

### Friday

Today will be a lecture on how we expect you to present and document your work. We'll be explaining how to deploy your site as well, using a modern system such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
